The game of Boggle is normally played on a 4x4 grid. 16 dice, each die printed with six characters from the letters A to Z, are placed in a closed container and the container is shaken. The dice land in the 4x4 grid and the letter on the top face is the letter for that grid square. A three-minute timer is typically started and players try and make as many words from the letters on the grid as they can before time runs out. These words have to follow certain rules - for this task we will assume the rules followed are:
Each letter (except for the first letter) must be adjacent (horizontally, vertically or diagonally) to its preceding letter.
A grid square's letter can only be used once (if there are two copies of the same letter appearing in different grid squares - both can be used).
The word must be one of the allowed words.
Though there are additional rules when played as a group of players, but points are assigned for the total number of letters in all valid words made.
